# NTF MINT

NFT Mint was a project developed following fireship.io NFT WEB3 tutorial:
https://fireship.io/lessons/web3-solidity-hardhat-react-tutorial/

During this project I learned:
 - How to randomly generated layered images with SVGs using node
 - Host images in IFPS using Pinata.
 - Creation of smart contract to mint those image as non-fungible-tokens using Solidty and Open Zeppelin.
 - Create a front-end interface where users can interact with those contracts using EthrJS and VIT
 
 To create your randomly generated images create a layers folders with the SVGs and replace the template with your own. Then rum `node index`
To run the front end application:

    npx hardhat node
    npx hardhat run scripts/sample-script.js --network localhost
    node run dev
